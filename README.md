## Notes

- This weeks assignment was a pretty hard challenge for me, I am slow to learn new syntax but I'm glad I think I got it down enough to work

- Towards the end of the assignment I figured out much easier ways to select the data I wanted, I did the save button first and I used a pretty roundabout way of navigating the DOM
